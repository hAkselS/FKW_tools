File:   create_pamguard_annotatoins.py

Spec:   This program looks at the spectrograms you have already made and assigns each one a datetime range.
        This program then looks at existing pamguard annotations and determines if
        the annotation falls within a time range of an existing spectrogram. If an annotation falls
        within the time range of a spectrogram, a new annotation is created and saved as a text file. 

I/O:    This program expects a CSV with the following category names: 
            "","UID","UTC","freqBeg","freqEnd","freqMean","freqStdDev","duration","freqSlopeMean","freqAbsSlopeMean","freqPosSlopeMean","freqNegSlopeMean","freqSlopeRatio","freqStepUp","freqStepDown","numSweepsDwnFlat","numSweepsDwnUp","numSweepsFlatDwn","numSweepsFlatUp","numSweepsUpDwn","numSweepsUpFlat","numInflections","freqCofm","freqQuarter1","freqQuarter2","freqQuarter3","freqSpread","freqMin","freqMax","freqRange","freqMedian","freqCenter","freqRelBw","freqMaxMinRatio","freqBegEndRatio","freqNumSteps","stepDur","freqBegSweep","freqBegUp","freqBegDwn","freqEndSweep","freqEndUp","freqEndDwn","freqSweepUpPercent","freqSweepDwnPercent","freqSweepFlatPercent","inflMaxDelta","inflMinDelta","inflMaxMinDelta","inflMeanDelta","inflStdDevDelta","inflMedianDelta","inflDur","BinaryFile","eventId","detectorName","db","species"
        The aforementioned CSV should be a fairly straight forward product created
        via exporting cruise data from R. 

Note:   The last three digits is the AC number. Ex: 1705109 is LaskerAC109
